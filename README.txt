11/2 (2 Hours):
—fruits falling from left and right sides of canvas
—object classes for different fruits
—random generation of fruits being "thrown"
—learned to use mouseMoved

—physics of throwing could be better
—should throwing be from sides of screen or bottom screen

11/4 (1 Hour):
—if fruit touched, remove from screen
—worked on timing of throws

11/7 (1 Hour):
—worked on fruit being thrown from bottom of screen
—figured out how to generate three fruits at once following
basic physics principles

11/12 (3 Hours):
—worked on gameOver screen, how to keep track of lives,
and how to reset
—worked on openCV and how to track brightest pixel on screen
—can think about interactions—is brightest pixel best interactive
method, or would color detection work better?

TP0

11/13 (1 Hour):
—implemented fruit pieces falling function

11/15 (2 Hours):
—improved falling objects to be semicircles
—added new fruits, including bomb which "blows" up if sliced
—added background
—added app.lives function

11/16 (2 Hours):
—added combo score with respect to timer
—fixed the length of app.fruits to match number of objects on screen
—think about position of hits on fruit and how it  can impact falling

11/17 (5 Hours):
—Talk with Andrew:
    —More features
    —2 min video demo
    —explain core complexities
—Worked on splash functions
—Cutting interactions to follow angle that user hits the fruits (polygonal cutting)

TP1

11/19 (1 Hour):
—Started working on title screen and help screen

11/21 (2 Hours):
—Worked title screen and helper screen
—Figured out cutting interaction to slice through play and help modes
—Figured out how to exit from screens
